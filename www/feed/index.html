<p>Firstly, a bit thank you for coming to see us at freshers! It was lovely to meet and talk to you all.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t had the chance to join yet, we have created a page with instructions on <a href="https://groups.surreyunion.org/EARS/how-to-join">how to join</a>.</p>



<p>We would like to invite all new members to our session on the <strong>4th October</strong> (time TBD) during which we&#8217;ll tell you more about the society and things available to you, as well as get feedback which will help us plan some events and workshops for the year.</p>



<p>We will send this information and updates out on our mailing list and only use the website for major updates so please do join up so you don&#8217;t miss anything!</p>



<p>Once again welcome and we cannot wait to begin!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>



<p>This year, we are switching things up a little!</p>



<p>We are currently in the process of implementing a new online Training system to allow new members to do all the required comprehension within their own time!</p>



<p>This way, you won&#8217;t need to come to one of our set training sessions throughout the year.</p>



<p>We will still be offering specialist equipment training, especially for 3D printers and the radio part of the society, but we hope this change makes our society accessible to more people.</p>



<p>More news to come in the next few weeks,</p>



<p>EARS Committee</p>
